# link:doc/Plugins.md[Plugins]

Plugins are implemented by implementing functionality that overlays/overwrites default functionality in the bot.  There are join points which allow plugins to add

## Commands

Commands are messages sent to the bot beginning with a name it has been configured to respond to.  The default name the bot will respond to is "bot" or "dammit bot".

### Die

Tells the bot to stop running.

## Scheduling

Scheduling plugins use Quartz.Scheduler to run code in backround threads at set schedules.

### Team City

The TeamCity plugin will connect to the web API of a JetBrains TeamCity server to notify a chat room as builds pass or fail.

## Protocols

The core bot has no functionality to connect to any chat protocols, rather this functionality is provided by plugins.

### Irc

Irc is one of the protocols for which there is a plugin.  It is currently the only such protocol.
