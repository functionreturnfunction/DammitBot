# DammitBot.Plugins.Reminders

This [DammitBot](../DammitBot.Core/README.md) library plugin adds functionality which allows users to set
reminders, which are messages that the bot will send to a user or channel at a predefined point in the
future.  This functionality is incomplete; just like
[DammitBot.Plugins.Data](../DammitBot.Plugins.Data/README.md) further plugged-in functionality is required
to actually persist and query data, as well as to maintain and evolve the database schema.
