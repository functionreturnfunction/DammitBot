# DateTimeStringParser

This library provides basic functionality for parsing date/time strings relative to a specific date/time,
such as "in 20 minutes" or "at 2:30". This is by no means comprehensive or feature-complete with the ruby
[chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic) gem it's inspired by.
