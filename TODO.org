* TODO Eliminate ChatSharp build warning
* TODO Move the dependency for Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core
  It doesn't belong in DammitBot.Plugins.Data.Dapper... really DB should be fully-configurable.
* TODO Replace DateTimeStringParser with something better (Chronic.NET?)
* TODO Test Coverage
** TODO  IOC Stuff
* DONE Get IDbConnection from a factory
  Could be related to above (it wasn't)
* DONE Fix UnitOfWork
